## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.11.3
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
  * `sudo apt install cmake`
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 7.4.0
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same instructions as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* IO2D for Linux systems
  * Pre-installed under folder P0267_RefImpl.
  * This library must be built in a place where CMake `find_package` will be able to find it
  * Follow below instructions to install IO2D...

  ```
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install build-essential
	sudo apt install cmake
	sudo apt install libcairo2-dev
	sudo apt install libgraphicsmagick1-dev
	sudo apt install libpng-dev
  ```
  
  `cd P0267_RefImpl`</br>
	`mkdir Debug` </br>
	`cd Debug`</br>
	`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..`</br>
	`cmake --build .`</br>
	`sudo make install`</br>
  * Installation instructions for all operating systems can be found [here](https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl/blob/master/BUILDING.md)
 

## Compiling and Running

### Compiling
To compile the project, first, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake` and `make` as follows:
```
cmake ..
make
```
### Running
The executable will be placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```
./OSM_A_star_search
```
Or to specify a map file:
```
./OSM_A_star_search -f ../<your_osm_file.osm>
```

## How to use Application

Once the program is compiled and run, it asks the user for 4 coordinates ranging from 0 to 99: start x, start y, end x and end y. Then it calculates the distance between these two points and renders the road from the start point to the end on the map. The map in .osm format must be named map.osm and placed in the project directory. A sample map is attached to the repo, but you can download your own from the page below.

[Download maps here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/54.91/-3.43)

## Testing

The testing executable is also placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the unit tests as follows:
```
./test
```

## Troubleshooting
* Some students have reported issues in cmake to find io2d packages, make sure you have downloaded [this](https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl/blob/master/BUILDING.md#xcode-and-libc).
* For MAC Users cmake issues: Comment these lines from CMakeLists.txt under P0267_RefImpl
    ```
    if( NOT DEFINED IO2D_WITHOUT_SAMPLES )
	     add_subdirectory(P0267_RefImpl/Samples)
    endif()
    ```
    And then run "ALL_Build" and "install" in XCode.
    
    If any packages are missing try to install packages using 
    ```
    brew install pkg-config
    ```
 * For Ubuntu Linux IO2D installation errors (shouldn't be any since its been pre-installed - see IO2D dependancies), follow the given steps:
   ```
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install build-essential
	sudo apt install cmake
	sudo apt install libcairo2-dev
	sudo apt install libgraphicsmagick1-dev
	sudo apt install libpng-dev

	git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl
	cd P0267_RefImpl
	mkdir Debug
	cd Debug
	cmake --config Debug "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" ..
	cmake --build .
	sudo make install
   ```
     
 * If you are working on windows and unable to install IO2D:
      * Enable WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and use a distribution like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/wsl).(available from the windows store): 
      * Install the required dependencies (compiler, cmake etc.) in the WSL(as mentioned above for ubuntu)
      * Configure CLion to use the WSL [toolchain](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/how-to-use-wsl-development-environment-in-product.html#wsl-tooclhain)
      * Use the WSL toolchain to build the project
      * If you are still facing errors, visit this [link](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Route-Planning-Project/issues/9).
     

* If you are facing errors with --config try to remove -- from the command.
